This is my first try on doing a simple HTTP Web Server in Python

In the repository there are a hello_world.py and a static_file_server.py

USAGE:
	The hello world server can be started with:
		./hello_world.py -or- python3 hello_world.py

	then go to http://localhost:8080/ and you should see "Hello, World!" there!

	The static file server serves all html files that are in the ./www/ directory and subdirectories
	to start it: 
		./static_file_server.py -or- python3 static_file_server.py
